ðŸ‘¥ Introduction
<p>A frontend-focus software engineer. I share about making software products through my articles; you can follow me on <a href='https://indieweb.social/web/@sayfessyd'>Mastodon</a>, <a href='https://medium.com/@sayfessyd'>Medium</a>, and <a href='https://dev.to/sayfessyd'>DEV</a> for up-to-date content and updates about my progress. In October 2015, I released my first <a href='https://www.producthunt.com/posts/lollipop-2-0'>baby</a> (i.e., product) which is a paid software for editing images. Outside of developing software, I enjoy playing the piano.</p>
